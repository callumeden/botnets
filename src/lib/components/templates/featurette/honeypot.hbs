    pc to be infected with malware and become part of the Botnet which is to be monitored.
    This pc will appear to be a regular member of the Botnet, so will behave as such.


    To get the computer infected it must be as vulnerable as possible and ideally have no useful function in a network

    With the dummy PC enrolled in the Botnet it&apos;s behaviour can now be monitored, taking note of which DNS/IP-adderss
    the bot connects to along with other information vital to the operation of the Botnet.

    All interactions between the infected computer and others inside a network, and the outside world, are suspicious
    and thus should be monitored closely

    uses a firewall to stop outgoing messages and record them, matching them against known suspicious IRC messages. This
    method has it&apos;s drawbacks as we cannot account for any machines that may become infected due to the propagation of
    the Botnet

    hence the behaviour of the Botnet can only be observed to a limited scale.
