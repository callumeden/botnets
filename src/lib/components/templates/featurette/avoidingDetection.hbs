    Botnets often use a range of techniques to evade the existing methods of detecting a bot and blocking its access to
    its master C & C server.
    For example, it may maintain a list of IP addresses with which it can connect with. It will then take a trial and
    error approach until it finds an active C & C server which responds and it can connect with.

    More advanced bots use Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA) and fast flux to ensure the bot is always able to
    communicate with its server.
