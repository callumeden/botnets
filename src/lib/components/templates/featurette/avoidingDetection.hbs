    Botnets often use a range of techniques to evade the existing methods of detecting a bot and blocking its access to
    its master C & C server.
    For example, it may maintain a list of IP addresses with which it can connect with. It will then take a trial and
    error approach until it finds an active C & C server which responds and it can connect with.

    More advanced bots use Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA) and fast flux to ensure the bot is always able to
    communicate with its server.

    <dd class="col-sm-9 col-sm-offset-3">The large number of potential rendezvous points makes it difficult for law
        enforcement to effectively shut down botnets since infected computers will attempt to contact some of these
        domain names every day to receive updates or commands

    <dd class="col-sm-9">The basic idea behind Fast flux is to have numerous IP addresses associated with a single fully
        qualified domain name, where the IP addresses are swapped in and out with extremely high frequency, through
        changing DNS records.
