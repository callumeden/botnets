    In order to propagate the Botnet further, the malware of a bot will seek to attack devices further through software
    vulnerabilities, vulnerabilities caused by other infections, social engineering through the use of email, instant
    messaging and malicious web
    page content.[ref]
    Further methods of propagation include the bot malware being propagated through peer to peer networks, open file
    sharing, and direct client to client file exchange [ref]

    However as the worm can duplicate itself and unceasingly take advantage of the system vulnerabilities and propagate
    as far as possible through the network, it will lead to a sharp increase in network traffic.
    This characteristic therefore makes the worm easily detectable.

    In order to avoid being easily detectable, the bots will often only propagte within certain limits or infect certain
    hosts according to the purpose of the controller during the process of propagating to avoid the detection by
    security researchers.

    <strong>A bot within a companies network</strong>
    The infected system can manipulate having access to a victim’s contacts and email account as a social
    engineering technique to send emails with malicious attachments. This will often lead to a higher conversion in
    malware installation as they will more likely perceive an email from a known contact to be genuine.

    Once a company’s network has been infected it could become a candidate for sending outbound SPAM or network
    attacks. This could possibly lead to the entire network being identified as a malicious source and therefore
    added to blacklists, impacting business operations. [17]
