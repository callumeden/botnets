    The presense of botnet software on an infected computer poses many threats to the victim. The bot may be used to
    participate in illegal activities, steal their information and identity or use to propagate their botnet
    further.

<h3>Data leakage/theft</h3>
<p>
    The bot applications will scour the user’s system searching for sensitive data such as passwords, personal
    identification information and bank account data which will then be automatically uploaded back to the master
    controller.
    This will allow the attacker to steal money from the victim’s bank account or through other means using
    identification information or passwords that have been stolen.

<h3>Propagating the botnet further</h3>
<p>
    The botnet software on a compromised system will scan the local network to propagate; such as once a worm enters
    a companies network, it can rapidly start spreading on the private network.
    The infected system can also manipulate having access to a victim’s contacts and email account as a social
    engineering technique to send emails with malicious attachments. This will often lead to a higher conversion in
    malware installation as they will more likely perceive an email from a known contact to be genuine.
    Once a company’s network has been infected it could become a candidate for sending outbound SPAM or network
    attacks. This could possibly lead to the entire network being identified as a malicious source and therefore
    added to blacklists, impacting business operations. [17]
