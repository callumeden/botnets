    The remaining mystery of a studied protocol is that of what constitutes a valid session of messages. Or more
    specifically, what sequences of messages are valid during an exchange and what sequences aren&apos;t. This set of message
    sequences is best expressed by a finite state machine, specifically a Mealy machine

    In simpler terms, a mealy machine is a finite state machine whose output is determined by current state and input.
    The inputs to the machine, in this case, are representative of messages sent by the bot to a botnet server. And the
    outputs representative of the botnet server&apos;s response.

    allows for mealy machine inference provided there is some teacher that can confirm a correct proposition or respond
    with a counter example when supplied with a mealy machine

    In brief, queries are made to the teacher in the form of strings representing sequences of input who responds with
    strings representing sequences of output behaviour. The input and output strings are stored in an observation table.
    The algorithm processes the observation table and proposes a mealy machine to the teacher. The teacher replies with
    some counter-example that distinguishes the proposed mealy machine with the actual mealy machine.
