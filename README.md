# Analysing Botnets and their C&C structure

##### A single page web application developed using Marionette.js and Backbone.js with the purpose of informing a technical but non-expert audience on Botnets and their Command and Control structure.

## Research: 

#### Research Areas:
* How are botnets established? 
* What architecture and communication protocols do they use? 
* How to detect them? 
* How to uncover their C & C structure and behavior? 

## Website:

#### Getting Started:

1. Clone the project: `git clone https://gitlab.doc.ic.ac.uk/g1516304/topics.git`
2. Enter project directory `cd topics`
3. Install dependencies `npm install`
4. Build! `grunt dev` 
5. Your browser should now open your local instance of the project (at <b> localhost:8080 </b>)

#### Developing:
* All main changes should be done on a separate branch
* As you make your changes, the grunt build watcher should run and rebuild. Simply refreshing the browser should then allow you to see your changes. 
* Commit changes to your branch and push your branch to repo when done (`git push origin yourBranchName`)
* Create a merge request, add a few points describing your changes and assign it to someone in the group to give a brief review
